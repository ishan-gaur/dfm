- [ ] Implement Tanja work as pilot for classifier stuff
    - [ ] How do you support both cdf below and above with just values
    - [ ] Make a NormalPDF model (stub for RegressionEnsemble, which inherits from this)
    - [ ] Add the ClassificationPredictiveModel
    - [ ] Define an embedding model protocol so that you can just pass the model class to the linear probe and it can use it
- [ ] Just name the transition functions or the predictor log probs their math names?? At least its self documenting the shape and all
- [ ] These context managers feel a bit stupid, seems fine to just condition in place and have to call unconditional when you want that
    - [ ] If we keep it, just add a wrapper for the variable that auto adds the method to the class
- [ ] Add a TAGModel for getting likelihoods
- [ ] Need to support individual and total temperatures--perhaps via the sampling method
- [ ] Classifier training script
    - [ ] Dataset interface with collators
    - [ ] Add a classifier to the predictive models
- [ ] Guided sampling
- [ ] TAG
    - Euler integrator
- [ ] Conditional Model Example
- [ ] Do an autoregressive example and do twisted SMC

# TO TEST
- Guided Sampling
    - That the TokenizerTranslator actually does map between the PredictiveModel and GenerativeModel
